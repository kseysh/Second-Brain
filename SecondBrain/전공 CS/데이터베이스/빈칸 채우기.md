- R₁ ∩ R₂가 R₁ 또는 R₂의 **super key**이면 Lossless-join Decomposition가 된다.
- 각 파일은 고정 길이의 저장 단위인 **Block**들로 나뉨
- null 값은 **null-value bitmap**으로 표현
- **Slotted Page Header**에는 다음 정보가 포함됨: ... (or **Slotted Page Structure**)
- if no free space, insert the record in an **overflow block**

- If the node has too few entries due to the removal, and the entries in the node and a *sibling fit into a single node*, then **merge siblings**
- Otherwise, if the node has too few entries due to the removal, but the entries in the node and a *sibling do not fit into a single node*, then **redistribute pointers** 
- use **primary-index search key** instead of record pointer in secondary index
- Non-leaf nodes are **larger**, so **fan-out** is **reduced**. Thus, B-Trees typically have **greater depth** than corresponding B+-Tree
- **Composite search keys** are search keys containing more than one attribute
